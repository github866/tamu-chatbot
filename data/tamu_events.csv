  Facilitators: Ginessa Payne, Center for Teaching Excellence


  Description: This four-session pronunciation workshop systematically explores the vocal tract and segments of speech that make meaningful differences in North American English. Through a variety of activities and handouts, attendees will become familiar with each consonant sound and with resources to practice listening discrimination and accurate pronunciation on their own. They each have the opportunity to get personalized feedback on their own pronunciation.&#160;Those who attend Part 1 will automatically be registered for Parts 2-4, which occur at the same time and place the following weeks.


  Learning Outcomes: Participants will be able to:


  1. Distinguish consonant sounds from consonant letters


  2. When listening, discern voiced consonants from voiceless consonants, and discern the different manners of articulation (stop, fricative, affricate, approximant, and nasal)


  3. When speaking, shift between voiced and voiceless at will; produce consonants with different manners of articulation and different places of articulation


  4. Identify one digital resource to use for ongoing pronunciation development

Each participant delivers a 5-minute presentation, receiving constructive feedback from a consultant and an undergraduate student on pronunciation, presentation structure, visual aids, nonverbal communication and more. By presenting in front of a friendly audience, participants develop confidence, and by observing peers’ presentations, they gain additional insight into best practices for comprehensible and well-developed presentations.


  Learning Outcomes: Participants will be able to: 1. Construct and deliver short, well-structured and intelligible presentations 2. Create a visual aid to support key points 3. Identify areas for improvement in their own presentations and those of their peers

University Writing Center presents: Writing Abstracts,Zoom,"
  Abstracts are a staple of academic communication. While abstracts can be difficult to write, they allow readers to focus on those articles, dissertations, or presentations that are essential to their own research. So knowing how to write one–how to attract the right readers and stay within the word count–is an important skill to develop.


  To sign up for our workshop, please use this Zoom registration link: https://tamu.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJMvdOysqTMvG9ao43tH5MUVXfP3VQTJ_KgB&#160;
  After registering, you will receive a confirmation email from Zoom with the meeting link and password.
  
  Attending this event and completing the reflection in eCampus is worth 1 PDU towards a G.R.A.D. Aggies Professional Development Certificate for graduate &amp; professional students. Visit grad-aggies.tamu.edu for more information.

Deadline: Faculty Research Small Seed Grants,,"
  The Race &amp; Ethnic Studies Institute annually funds a number of Faculty Small Research Seed Grants up to $2,500 each. There will be two competitions – one in the Fall and one in the Spring.


  By default, the awards run for roughly one calendar year. We expect Fall awards to be announced in November and Spring awards to be announced in April. Funds will be set to expire and be returned one year after the funds have been awarded. Exceptions can be made; we just ask that any such requests are communicated to us in a timely manner (ideally as part of the application process).

Deadline: Undergraduate Research Grants,,"The Race &amp; Ethnic Studies Institute (RESI) is offering a number of research grants to current Texas A&amp;M University undergraduate students. This is, essentially, a major project grant to support the research enterprise leading to successful completion of some significant, faculty-directed project. In general, applicants should have second, third, or fourth-year standing; but RESI will consider proposals from exceptional students in their first year. As this award is also intended to provide students with grant-writing experience, students are expected to work closely with a faculty member on a project description, the rationale for the grant, and budget. Faculty are expected to provide feedback on a draft proposal and write a confidential letter directly to RESI.",October 1
