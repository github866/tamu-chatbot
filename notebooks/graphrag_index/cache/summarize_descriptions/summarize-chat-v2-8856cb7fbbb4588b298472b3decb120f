{"result": " Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), often referred to as ConvNets, are a specific type of artificial neural network primarily utilized across various domains. They are particularly designed to process structured grid data, such as images. However, it is important to note that CNNs have certain limitations, including difficulties in understanding global context and being perceived as black-box models. Despite these challenges, they remain valuable tools in the field of machine learning and computer vision.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
